      question: "Why did Gigleaz stop in 2024?",
      answer: "Gigleaz paused on July 18, 2024 due to corruption, internal sabotage, and threats, not because of cheating the public."
    },
    {
      question: "Did Gigleaz commit fraud or crime?",
      answer: "No â€” all news articles alleging fraud were false, paid, and without evidence; we are taking legal action for defamation."
    },
    {
      question: "Why was the CEO kidnapped?",
      answer: "Founder Ravichandra Reddy was kidnapped by a group exploiting Gigleaz for personal gain; he was rescued, and cases are being pursued."
    },
    {
      question: "What role did journalists play?",
      answer: "Certain journalists acted as mediums for misinformation, publishing accusations without proof â€” but they are not judges."
    },
    {
      question: "Was Gigleaz shut down by officials?",
      answer: "Yes, the pause came under police pressure and systemic corruption, not by voluntary closure or cheating."
    },
    {
      question: "What happened to employees and students?",
      answer: "Illegal hires and fake offers were created by consultants, not Gigleaz; the genuine workforce and students were always honored."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Gigleaz today?",
      answer: "Gigleaz is no longer a company â€” it has been rebuilt as a product inside a US-based EdTech ecosystem."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the vision of Gigleaz 2.0?",
      answer: "To become the world's first Learn & Earn OTT platform, where every learner gains skills, community, and income opportunities."
    },
    {
      question: "When is the relaunch?",
      answer: "ðŸ“… November 18, 2025 â€“ Gigleaz 2.0 official comeback."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you still believe in justice?",
      answer: "Yes â€” Justice will be given, truth will prevail, and we trust the court to remove defamatory articles."
